  - Squamous Cell Carcinoma
  - Adenocarcinoma
- Detailed medical report generation
- Interactive visualization of results
- User registration and history tracking

## Technical Stack

- Python 3.11+
- Streamlit for web interface
- PyTorch for deep learning (ResNet18)
- SQLite for database

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd LungScan-AI
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up secrets:
   - Copy `.streamlit/secrets.template.toml` to `.streamlit/secrets.toml`
   - Fill in your credentials in `secrets.toml`:
   ```toml
   ADMIN_USERNAME = "your_admin_username"
   ADMIN_PASSWORD = "your_secure_password"
   DATABASE_PATH = "your_database_path"
   MODEL_URL = "your_model_download_url"
   ```
   - Never commit `secrets.toml` to version control

4. Ensure the model file is in the correct location:
```
models/lung_cancer_detector.pth
```

## Running the Application

```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

## Deployment

### Local Deployment
1. Follow the installation steps above
2. Run the application using `streamlit run src/app.py`
3. Access the application at `http://localhost:8501`

### Streamlit Cloud Deployment
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Visit [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Select src/app.py as the main file
5. Deploy
